Runoff is a program that simulates a runoff election. The user enters the number of voters, then for each voter, a rank of the candidates. 
The program then returns the winner of the election under the rules of a runoff election, where any candidate with a majority of the first 
preference votesare declared the winner of the election. If no candidate receives a majority of the first preference votes, a runoff is conducted, 
where the candidate(s) with the fewest number of votes are eliminated, and the majority assessment runs again. This code is part of a problem set 
for Harvard's computer science course CS50 in Week 3, Algorithms.

Helpers is part of a program that applies filters to an image. In this program, I coded 4 different filters: grayscale, reverse, sepia, and blur.
I used the RGB values of each pixel to determine the new set of RGB values after applying a filter. This code is part of a problem set for CS50 in
Week 4, Memory.

Recover is part of a program that recovers "deleted" .JPEG files from a memory drive by recognizing hexadecimal tags that indicate the start of a
.JPEG file. After reading the contents of the memory drive, I wrote it into a new file where the lost images could be visualized. This code is part
of a problem set for CS50 in Week 4, Memory.
